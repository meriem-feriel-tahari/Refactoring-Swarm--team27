inside the graph.py im going to create nodes and edges 
inside state.py it's going to be just a stateworkflow that can be pased between agnets
////
after getting arguments from cli i need to parcour every file recursivly 
so when i receive the file i will read it and pass its content to the prompt
 and keep it in the flow state so ican pass it from agent to other agent
